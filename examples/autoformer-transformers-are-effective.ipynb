We also provided an example for multivariate probabilistic forecasting with Informer. In this post, we discuss the question: [Are Transformers Effective for Time Series Forecasting?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13504) (AAAI 2023). As we will see, they are.\n",

Our comparison shows that the simple linear model, known as _DLinear_, is not better than Transformers as claimed. When compared against equivalent sized models in the same setting as the linear models, the Transformer-based models perform better on the test set metrics we consider.\n",
        "Afterwards, we will introduce the _Autoformer_ model ([Wu, Haixu, et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13008)), which was published in NeurIPS 2021 after the Informer model. The Autoformer model is [now available](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/autoformer) in 🤗 Transformers. Finally, we will discuss the _DLinear_ model, which is a simple feedforward network that uses the decomposition layer from Autoformer.

This is achieved through the incorporation of a _Decomposition Layer_, which enhances the model's ability to capture these components accurately. Moreover, Autoformer introduces an innovative auto-correlation mechanism that replaces the standard self-attention used in the vanilla transformer. This mechanism enables the model to utilize period-based dependencies in the attention, thus improving the overall performance.\n",

        "In time series analysis, [decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decomposition_of_time_series) is a method of breaking down a time series into three systematic components: trend-cycle, seasonal variation, and random fluctuations.\n",
        "The trend component represents the long-term direction of the time series, which can be increasing, decreasing, or stable over time. The seasonal component represents the recurring patterns that occur within the time series, such as yearly or quarterly cycles. Finally, the random (sometimes called \"irregular\") component represents the random noise in the data that cannot be explained by the trend or seasonal components.\n",
        "\n",
        "Two main types of decomposition are additive and multiplicative decomposition, which are implemented in the [great statsmodels library](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.tsa.seasonal.seasonal_decompose.html). By decomposing a time series into these components, we can better understand and model the underlying patterns in the data.\n",

As can be seen, the encoder and decoder use a decomposition block to aggregate the trend-cyclical part and extract the seasonal part from the series progressively. The concept of inner decomposition has demonstrated its usefulness since the publication of Autoformer. Subsequently, it has been adopted in several other time series papers, such as FEDformer ([Zhou, Tian, et al., ICML 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12740)) and DLinear [(Zeng, Ailing, et al., AAAI 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13504), highlighting its significance in time series modeling.\n",

Since the DLinear model has no capacity to incorporate covariates, in particular any date-time features, the context window we give it does not have enough information to figure out if the prediction is for the weekend or weekday. Thus, the model will predict the more common of the patterns, namely the weekdays leading to poorer performance on weekends. Of course, by giving it a larger context window, a linear model will figure out the weekly pattern, but perhaps there is a monthly or quarterly pattern in the data which would require bigger and bigger contexts."

        "\n",
        "As one can observe, the [vanilla Transformer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/time_series_transformer) which we introduced last year gets the best results here. Secondly, multivariate models are typically _worse_ than the univariate ones, the reason being the difficulty in estimating the cross-series correlations/relationships. The additional variance added by the estimates often harms the resulting forecasts or the model learns spurious correlations. Recent papers like [CrossFormer](https://openreview.net/forum?id=vSVLM2j9eie) (ICLR 23) and [CARD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12095) try to address this problem in Transformer models.\n",
        "Multivariate models usually perform well when trained on large amounts of data. However, when compared to univariate models, especially on smaller open datasets, the univariate models tend to provide better metrics. By comparing the linear model with equivalent-sized univariate transformers or in fact any other neural univariate model, one will typically get better performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "To summarize, Transformers are definitely far from being outdated when it comes to time-series forcasting!\n",
        "Yet the availability of large-scale datasets is crucial for maximizing their potential.\n",
        "Unlike in CV and NLP, the field of time series lacks publicly accessible large-scale datasets.\n",
        "Most existing pre-trained models for time series are trained on small sample sizes from archives like [UCR and UEA](https://www.timeseriesclassification.com/),\n",
        "which contain only a few thousands or even hundreds of samples.\n",
        "Although these benchmark datasets have been instrumental in the progress of the time series community,\n",
        "their limited sample sizes and lack of generality pose challenges for pre-training deep learning models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, the development of large-scale, generic time series datasets (like ImageNet in CV) is of the utmost importance.\n",
        "Creating such datasets will greatly facilitate further research on pre-trained models specifically designed for time series analysis, and it will improve the applicability of pre-trained models in time series forecasting.\n",
